# replication_Marwick2025_OpenAlex

This repository contains the necessary files to replicate, with [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) data, [Marwick 2025 Is archaeology a science?], the first part of his article published in June 2025 in Journal of Archaeological Science. The second part of the paper about his role as reproducibility officer in JAS is nos reproduced nor replicated.

The preprint created through this quarto document and the other files shared in this repository is available in [html format](https://aqueff.github.io/replication_Marwick2025_OpenAlex/) (for more interactivity with code chuncks and table of content, this is the unique goal of the index.html at the root of repository) and in [.docx format on SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2k9av_v1). It may be submitted to [PCI Archaeology](https://archaeo.peercommunityin.org/) for evaluation since I find reproduction and replication studies severely lacking from the archaeological literature. In this text, I first explain why I tried to reproduce the article (to learn mainly), and why I wanted to replicated it (because I like the OpenAlex initiative and wanted to see if one can get the same results, and also to learn how to do so). And I then apply Marwick's protocol and code, modified for the data from OpenAlex, to see if the results are replicable with this other bibliographic database which is free and open source, and I discuss the similarities and differences.

This repository is organized in the same way as [Marwick's](https://github.com/benmarwick/web-of-science-archaeology) and some files are identical to his files since they worked perfectly even with the OpenAlex data.

In parallel to this repository containing my manuscript, data and code, I also pushed a commit to Marwick's GitHub repository, with corrections to few errors I identified while reproducing his paper and replicating it with OpenAlex data.

I hope this is the way to do a reproduction and replication process. I am not used to it and didn't find many example (0 in archaeology) to rely on.

I want here to thank Ben Marwick for inspiring me for years in open science practices, and for sharing so many things with the community so we can learn from it.
